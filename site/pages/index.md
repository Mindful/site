Hi there! My name is Joshua Tanner, and this is my corner of the internet. I'm currently a research intern at the University of Tokyo's Institute of Industrial Science, but most of my professional experience has been as a software engineer working in Seattle. 

If you are interested in hiring me to work on something related to software development or natural language processing, please see [here](link://slug/technical). 
If you're here for interpretation or translation services, please see [here](link://slug/translation).

Alternatively, if you would like to collaborate on research or an open-source project of some kind, please feel free to reach out. I am most interested in language-related projects - in particular those that support language learners - but I am always in the market for new ideas. Some of my previous projects can be seen [here](link://slug/projects). 

Contact information, including my email and other online profiles, can be found in the icons at the bottom of the page.
