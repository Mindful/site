I primarily offer English/Japanese sequential interpretation, although I can also translate documents or other text. Much of my experience has been in the form of interpreting panels and other interactions for conference guests, but an up-to-date summary of my experience can be seen in my <a href="/resume-technical-english.pdf">resume</a>.

If you need interpretation or translation of content relating to software development or artificial intelligence, my experience working in these fields in both Japanese and English makes me uniquely qualified to help. Please feel free to [email](mailto:{{% email %}}) me with questions.
